# Analysis_of_Football_Players_Rating_in_2016
Working with a database of European Soccer collected over a period of 9 years (2007 - 2016), the data will be analysed to find out how players attributes affect the overall and potential ratings of the players for the year 2016. This is my first project submission for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
